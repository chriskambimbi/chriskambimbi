A letter falls, silent and cold,
Its words like whispers, harsh and bold.
The dream I cradled in tender hands,
Slipped like grains of desert sands.

I gave my heart, my soul, my will,
Each sleepless night, each silent hill.
The prayers I wove in threads of light,
Now rest in shadows, veiled by night.

A hollow ache, a silent sting,
For dreams deferred, and hopes that cling,
To what might have been, a different way,
A path untraveled, lost to yesterday.

Oh cruel verdict, sharp and swift,
You steal the joy, the hopeful lift.
Yet in the sorrow, grace I find,
A peace that mends the fractured mind.

To those who stand where I once dreamed,
Hold tight the gift, though undeserved it seemed.
For many long to wear your crown,
To rise where others have fallen down.

And to myself, this heart of mine,
Let gratitude and effort intertwine.
The world turns on, the story grows,
Through jagged thorns, a new path shows.

So count it all, the joy, the pain,
Each loss, a lesson; each tear, a gain.
Rejection may sting, but still I rise,
Chasing tomorrow, beneath endless skies.
